# AI Elements - AI Chat Application

A modern AI chat application that demonstrates real-world implementation of full-stack web development concepts with AI integration.

**🌐 Live Demo**: Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)  
**🤖 AI Provider**: Uses [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) for multi-model AI access

## 📚 Core Concepts Explained

### What is a Full-Stack Web Application?

A **full-stack application** has both frontend (what users see) and backend (server logic) components working together. Think of it like a restaurant: the frontend is the dining area and menu (user interface), while the backend is the kitchen (where the actual work happens).

**In this project**: We use Next.js which combines both frontend React components and backend API routes in one codebase.

### What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

**Traditional websites**: Browser downloads HTML, then JavaScript runs to make it interactive (slow)  
**SSR**: Server creates the full HTML page before sending it to browser (fast)

**In this project**: Next.js pre-renders our chat interface on the server, so users see content immediately.

### What are API Routes?

**API Routes** are server endpoints that handle requests and return data. Like ordering food: you make a request ("I want pizza"), the kitchen processes it, and returns the result.

**In this project**: `/api/chat` receives your message, sends it to AI models, and streams the response back.

### What is Real-time Streaming?

**Traditional approach**: Send request → wait → get complete response  
**Streaming**: Send request → receive response in chunks as it's generated

**In this project**: AI responses appear word-by-word as the model generates them, just like ChatGPT.

### What is Component-Based Architecture?

Instead of one giant HTML file, we break the UI into reusable **components**. Like LEGO blocks - each piece has a specific purpose and can be reused.

**In this project**: We have separate components for messages, input fields, buttons, etc. that can be combined and reused.

### What is State Management?

**State** is data that changes over time (like your current conversation). Managing state means keeping track of these changes and updating the UI accordingly.

**In this project**: We track conversation history, loading states, and user input using React hooks.

### What is TypeScript?

**JavaScript**: Flexible but error-prone (like writing without spell-check)  
**TypeScript**: JavaScript with type checking (like having a grammar assistant)

**In this project**: TypeScript catches errors before they reach users and makes the code more reliable.

### What is an AI Gateway?

Instead of connecting to each AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) separately, an **AI Gateway** provides one interface to access multiple models.

**In this project**: OpenRouter acts as our gateway, giving us access to 100+ AI models through one API.

## 🛠️ Technology Implementation

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with SSR and API routes
- **React 19** - Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives

### Backend & AI

- **Next.js API Routes** - Server-side request handling
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Streaming AI responses
- **OpenRouter** - Multi-model AI gateway
- **Streaming responses** - Real-time data flow

### Deployment & Hosting

- **Vercel** - Edge-optimized hosting platform
- **Environment variables** - Secure configuration management

## 🏗️ How It All Works Together

1. **User types message** → React state updates
2. **Form submission** → Triggers API call to `/api/chat`
3. **API route** → Sends message to OpenRouter
4. **OpenRouter** → Forwards to selected AI model (GPT-4, etc.)
5. **AI model** → Generates response and streams it back
6. **Our API** → Forwards stream to frontend
7. **Frontend** → Displays response word-by-word in real-time

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime)
- **pnpm** (Package manager)
- **OpenRouter account** (AI access)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ai-elements
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   # Create environment file
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Add your OpenRouter API key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Start development**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Getting OpenRouter API Key

1. Visit [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Create account → Go to "Keys" → Generate new key
3. Add $5-10 credits for testing
4. Copy key to `.env.local`
